# Qubic and the Tick
If you come from other blockchains, you may know the `Block`, in Qubic we call this a `Tick`.

A Tick mainly consists out of this data:

- [TickData](TickData.md)
- [Tick](Tick.md) votes
- [Transactions](Transaction.md)

With the above data present, a `Tick` can be calculated. (similar to `Blocks`)
